# Branding Guidelines

## Name and Capitalization

The official naming and capitalization is **RateTheDub**. Other acceptable
versions include:

- Rate the Dub
- Rate The Dub

"RatetheDub" with a lowercase T in "the" should be avoided for clarity reasons.

The abbreviation **RtD** is also acceptable, but "RTD" with a capital should be
avoided for clarity.

## Slogan

The official slogan of Rate the Dub is...

> Is the dub for that anime any good?

It should be translated into relevant languages whenever possible.

## Font

The current font used for both the logo and website is
[Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) by Jonny Pinhorn.
In particular RateTheDub uses the
[Fontsource version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fontsource/poppins).

## Colors

The full color palette is
[viewable on Coolors](https://coolors.co/2d3142-bfc0c0-ffffff-ef8354-4f5d75-646f4b-e85f5c).
These colors are available as Tailwind color names in the RateTheDub frontend.

## Logo

The logo and other branding assets can be found in the
[branding folder](../branding/) including the HTML draft that the original logo
is based off of.
