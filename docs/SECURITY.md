# Security Policy

The RateTheDub security policy for vulnerabilities and other security flaws.

Please understand that this document is a best-effort policy and that the
author is not a trained cybersecurity expert.

## Supported Versions

The only supported versions are the
[latest tagged release](https://github.com/rushsteve1/RateTheDub/releases)
or the `main` branch of the
[official RateTheDub repository](https://github.com/rushsteve1/RateTheDub).
Any other releases, branches, or forks are **NOT** supported.

The deployed version at [RateTheDub.com](https://ratethedub.com) tracks the
latest tagged release so follows the above release policy.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**The more information your provide the easier it will be to fix the issue. Pull
Requests are always welcome!**

Please follow
[Responsible Disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure)
and report all security vulnerabilities to
[contact@ratethedub.com](mailto:contact@ratethedub.com).

If you _really_ want to report a vulnerability with
[Full Disclosure](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_disclosure_(computer_security)>)
please at least mention the
[RateTheDub Twitter account](https://twitter.com/RateTheDub)
so that we know about it. But please consider emailing us about the vulnerability
instead!

Depending on the scope and severity of the vulnerability a
[Security Advisory](https://github.com/rushsteve1/RateTheDub/security/advisories)
will be posted here on GitHub.
